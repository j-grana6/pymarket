Review : This paper takes a similar approach to mine but there are some flaws and
 differences.

Flaw : They misinterpret prospect theory preferences.  In essence, prospect theory
agents are backward looking.

Model Difference : I am using an order-book market instead of an ad-hoc market
clearing mechanism.

Model Difference : In their model, Agents trade at random, in my model the order of
trade will be determined by agent's valuation.  This will add some mathematical structure
(I **think** my model can be formulated as a continuous time Markov chain, but I
 need to think about this.)

Major design difference : I am more concerned with "who trades with who" when
the fundamental price is shocked.  This captures the dynamics of the adjustment process.
